## SDL_gesture

SDL3 is removing the Gesture API that was available in SDL2, so as a migration
path, we are providing an equivalent as a single-header library that you
can drop into your SDL3-based project.

We do not make formal releases of this code; just grab the latest and drop
it into your project!

To use:

- Copy SDL_gesture.h into your project.
- Wherever you need access to this functionality, `#include` the header,
  _after_ including SDL.h.
- In **ONLY ONE PLACE** in your project, make sure you've `#defined`
  SDL_GESTURE_IMPLEMENTATION before including the header:


  ```c
  #define SDL_GESTURE_IMPLEMENTATION 1
  #include "SDL_gesture.h"
  ```

  This will make the header include not just function declarations and such
  but also its implementation code.
- To use the API, call this somewhere near startup, after SDL_Init:

  ```c
  Gesture_Init();
  ```

  and then, before you call SDL_Quit at the end of your program:

  ```c
  Gesture_Quit();
  ```

  Now you will get Gesture events from the SDL event queue.
- SDL_RecordGesture, SDL_SaveAllDollarTemplates, SDL_SaveDollarTemplate, and
  SDL_LoadDollarTemplates work as before, they are just prefixed with
  "Gesture_" instead of "SDL_". Same with event types.
- It is safe to add this to SDL2-based projects, as it will just use SDL2's
  existing API under the hood.
